Description: sqrpr provides a set of tools for calculating NWEA MAP based
    metrics that are used by CPS in calculating SQRP levels for schools. These
    tools take into account varios CPS idiosyncracies like truncating gorwth at
    the 1st and 99th percentiles, using a CPS specific distribution for
    school-level growth norms, and the 36 week spring-to-spring NWEA growth
    calendar.
