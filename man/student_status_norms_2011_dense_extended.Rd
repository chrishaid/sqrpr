\description{
Builds on student_status_norms_2011. Two data processing steps have been performed:
1) densification by percentile.  For many grade levels, one step on the RIT scale 
equates to more than one percentile point.  For instnace, moving from RIT 212 to 213
might be a jump from the 51st to 54th percentile.  This dataframe 'densifies' the 
scale so that entries exist for the 52nd and 53rd percentile (mapping back to RIT 212).
2) extending norms into HS.  The normative study doesn't cover all grades and subjects - 
in 2011, comparatively few HS students took MAP.  Rather than return nothing at all
for, say, 12th grade Reading, this data frame extends the norms from the previous grade
where data exists.  This is an imperfect approximation, to be sure, but is at least 
directionally accurate.
